The installation process is very simple. If you are already using shadcn/ui, you can skip this step and go straight to installing components.

If not using shadcn/ui yet, you can follow the steps below:

1. First, follow the [installation instructions](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) for shadcn/ui in your project.

2. Make sure you're using the modern `shadcn` CLI (not the legacy `shadcn-ui`).

3. Install components using the CLI.
