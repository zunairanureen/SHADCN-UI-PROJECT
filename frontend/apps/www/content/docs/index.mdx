  <AccordionTrigger>Is this an official shadcn project?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    No, this is not an official shadcn/ui project. This is a component kit built
    by <Icons.blazity className="mx-1 mb-1 inline-block h-4 w-4" />
    <span className="text-blazity">Blazity</span>, that follows shadcn/ui's design
    philosophy and methodology. We've built it to be fully compatible with the shadcn/ui
    ecosystem, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it with existing shadcn/ui components
    while maintaining the same level of customization and control over your code.

    How does the AI integration work?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    The kit is designed to work seamlessly with the Vercel AI SDK out of the box, making it easy to integrate with popular AI providers. Simply use the `useChat` hook from the Vercel AI SDK, and pass the returned properties to our Chat component.

    However, you're not limited to the Vercel AI SDK. The components are built to be provider-agnostic, allowing you to implement your own custom AI integration.
